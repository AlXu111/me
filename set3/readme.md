TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
16/06/22
16:15 - started on exercise one, test files do not work
16:25 - got ben to fix it, if there is another problem, print this command in terminal
pip install matplotlib
17:03 - if there is a "while True" line, it just keeps running until the function "return" is true
18:07 - finally function is always gone to no matter if it keeps coming up with an error, if you still want it to loop, have a flag or condition, in a while true loop. see how it works in ex1, super asker
