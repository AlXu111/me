TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
using something.columns gives an index, which looks like a list but cannot be used like a list
NaN = not a number = a blank in the values
penalty_data.FACE_VALUE[penalty_data.FACE_VALUE < 3000].hist() - the square bracket produces a whole bunch of true and false and can be partitioned and cull the falses etc etc
pd.Series(range(100)) - s in Series is capital because its a class. Series looks at one row/column thingy
if you put a semicolon at the end of ur code in pandas, it gets rid of the random junk before showing the graph


really helps with refactoring and getting different functions to call over and over again
ctrl+shift+L for the mutlivariable one
i am editing this because i need to set up my git stuff because my old laptop died
