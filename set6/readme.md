TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
Inappropriate Naming - you need to make sure ur name actually describes what the code does
Bloated functions - if ur code takes up more than a screen, its a good sign you should start refactoring
Unnecessarily complicated code
